# This file serves as an example for configuring environment variables for the project.
# Copy this file to `.env` and add the required environment variables as needed.

# .env files are used to store environment-specific settings, such as API keys, database
# credentials, or other sensitive information. These variables are loaded into your app
# during runtime.

# Example steps:
# 1. Duplicate this file: `cp .env.example .env`
# 2. Open the new `.env` file and add the necessary values for your environment.
# 3. Do not commit `.env` to version control, as it may contain sensitive information.

# Note:
# The `.env` file will not be committed to Git if itâ€™s listed in `.gitignore`.
# This ensures that sensitive data is kept private.
# Do not include any sensitive information in this file that you do not want exposed to the public.
